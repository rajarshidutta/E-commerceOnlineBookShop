# E-commerceOnlineBookShop

• Developed an e-commerce book store platform with admin and user
panels. In the admin panel, all the clients are listed and allow to
manage new books for sale while the user panel allows users to
purchase books from the store and also sell their existing old books.

• Implemented a search functionality where any user can search for
books by tags such as book name, author name, and category, and
they will receive the most relevant results that match their search
query.

• Implemented CRUD Operations.
